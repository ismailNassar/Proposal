\chapter*{Abstract}
The generation of a pair of entangled photons from the biexcition-exciton cascade is complicated by the presence of fine structure splitting (FSS). Many methods were implemented to overcome the problem with varying degrees of success, but the problem continues to persist.  \\
This research proposal aims to approach the problem differently by implementing a scheme for fast polarization manipulation of entangled photon pairs.\\
This scheme can be potentially used as a method for fast photon rerouting in integrated photonics.
